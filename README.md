# Community-Connect-Page-Builder
I embarked on Project-based learning using Google Gemini 2.5 pro (for reasoning, math and code). The project allows users to create their business profile cards and share it with their community. 

# Features 
- Change colour of the business card (to light,dark, and ocean)
- View the loadshedding status
- Copy HTML button to export the card

# Technologies used 
- Google Gemini: As an AI-powered tool for guidance, code generation, and debugging.
- HTML5: For the core structure of the web application and the generated page. 
- CSS3 (with Tailwind SCC): For all the styling, layout, and responsive design.
- JavaScript (ES6+): For all the interactivity, DOM manipulation, event handling, and API logic.
- Visual Studio Code: As the primary code editor.
